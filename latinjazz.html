        <h1>Latin Jazz</h1>
        <h3>By Kooshul Jhaveri</h3>
        <p>
          Latin jazz emerged in the 1940s when musicians began combining Afro-Cuban music with bebop. In comparison with more traditional jazz, Latin jazz employs a different kind of rhythm. Early Latin jazz rarely employed a backbeat, but contemporary forms fuse the backbeat with the clave. Unique percussion instruments often replace a standard drum kit; for example, the conga, timbale, güiro, bongos, and claves are all very commonly heard in Latin jazz.

          I appreciate how Latin jazz bridges Latin culture with European and African musical elements to create a cohesive and distinctive sound. It is amazing how artists can take an instrument from one continent, rhythm from a second, and combine that with other elements and still make it sound great!
          In addition, the energy and spontaneity of Latin jazz is something you can rarely find outside of the genre. There is a certain intensity and vitality that I find appealing — it makes me feel more engaged compared to other sub-genres of jazz.

            <h4 id="koosh-header1">Tito Puente & Giovanni Hidalgo</h4>
            <p id="koosh-text1">
              Commonly seen in Latin jazz music, this song features timbales throughout the tune. Another characteristic of Latin jazz is the presence of percussion solos within a song and then a return to the melody. This can be seen from 1:00 to 1:30 when Giovanni Hidalgo solos on the conga drums. The percussion and rhythm of the song gives it a dance-floor vibe, a common theme amongst Latin jazz songs. The energy of the group is contributes to this, seen in the expressions of Puente (timbales), Hidalgo (conga drums), and Ruiz (piano). Watching Calle 54 and learning more about the history of Latin jazz and Tito Puente was very stimulating for me, partially because I have a childhood experience with Puente. In 2005, when I was 8 years old, Tito Puente was honored in a ceremony in New Jersey in the neighboring town from where I grew up – he received a star on the Walk of Fame as well. I remember hearing about this event and listening to some of his music
              after the event, and so seeing him again in the documentary reminded me of that experience.

            <h4>Mongo Santamaría – Watermelon Man</h4>
            <p id="koosh-text2">
              Watermelon Man was originally a piece by Herbie Hancock now regarded as a jazz standard. Mongo Santamaría was joined by timbalero Francisco "Kako" Baster in a cha-cha beat, while drummer Ray Lucas performed a backbeat. There is also a quite intriguing story behind the making of the Latin jazz version – once, when Hancock filled in for someone in Santamaría’s band, he played Watermelon Man and Mongo jumped in on the congas. The rest of the band soon joined as well, and the resulting sound was a hit!<br /><br />Listening to Santamaría’s Latin-jazz / pop rendition of the song was really enjoyable to me – one reason why is because it bears a striking resemblance Low Rider, a song written by American funk band War in 1975. I grew up listening to this song many times because it was the theme song to the sitcom George Lopez. It’s nearly impossible to forget those instantly recognizable cow bells!
