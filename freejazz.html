        <h1>Free Jazz</h1>
        <h3>By Edric Wung</h3>
        <p>
          I think that free jazz is the embodiment of musical freedom. Initially controversial and unwelcomed, the genre grew in popularity in the 1960s. Free jazz is characterized by its atonality and its rejection of preset chord sequences. This rejection of predetermined chord progressions makes me feel as though there are no boundaries. I believe it gives the musician more latitude to experiment with different sounds and play what he or she hears. Rejecting those chord changes therefore allows the musician to escape the limitations of bebop and truly play their own music. Ornette Coleman once explained that using preset chord changes means “you’re not playing all your own music, or all the music you’re playing’s not yours.” As an audience, there is no compass to guide you when listening to free jazz because it is so unpredictable and unique to the musician.

          The atonal nature of free jazz is also striking. When I first listened to free jazz, the atonality of songs made me feel uncomfortable because the sounds were unfamiliar. I later realized how these sounds, in conjunction with their rejection of fixed chord progressions, reflected the deep emotions of the artist and can be construed as reflective of the African American desire for freedom. Jazz had always been rooted in the African American struggle for freedom, but free jazz took it to the next level. I can sense the frustration and struggle in the playing styles of free jazz musicians, especially Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor. Below are pieces from Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor that are representative of free jazz.

            <h4>Ornette Coleman – Lonely Woman</h4>
            <p>
              Like most of his songs, I had to listen to “Lonely Woman” a few times before I could grasp the emotions Coleman is trying to convey. The song builds up from 2:20 until 2:33, when Coleman and Don Cherry play in an ascending manner. Then from 2:34-2:55, you can almost hear the cries of a lonely woman. The song is melodious yet extremely sad at the same time. This song is reflective of free jazz because of its lack of the usual rhythmic structure. Meanwhile, the song also involved collective improvisation with Coleman (alto saxophone), Cherry (cornet), Higgins (drums), and Haden (bass) playing off each other. Over the years, “Lonely Woman” has been one of Ornette Coleman’s most covered pieces.

            <h4>Cecil Taylor – Steps</h4>
            <p>
              When I first listened to this song, it was difficult to listen to. Like much of free jazz, Taylor’s piano initially sounded like random combinations of notes. However, after listening to it again I could sense the frustration and anger in Taylor’s intensity and percussive playing style. For example, from 5:02-5:07, Taylor slams on the same chord seven or eight times. I found that these emotions were rooted in his frustration with the treatment of African Americans and other social issues at the time. Similar to other free jazz groups, Taylor, McIntyre, Lyons, Stevens Jr., Silva, Grimes, and Cyrille acted as independent voices that played off one another.
