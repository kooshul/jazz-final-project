        <h1>Soul Jazz</h1>
        <h3>By Shannon Mukerji</h3>
        <p>
          When I think of soul jazz, I think of a blend and mix of many other types of music previously explored within jazz. A characteristic that really stands out to me is the difficulty in categorizing a specific style. I think soul jazz has lots of influences from blues and gospel music for example as seen by the rhythms and the different styles it incorporates. It truly is a blend and can be grouped as its own unique take on these inspirations to create a whole new branch of “soul” jazz.

            <h4>Ramsey Lewis Trio – The In Crowd</h4>
            <p id="shannon-text1">
              These two songs we discussed in class that really exemplify the elements that describe soul jazz. “The In Crowd” demonstrates these characteristics of soul jazz. The song really resonated with me because I found it was very engaging and interesting to listen to. I could feel myself really getting into the music and the beat. When the bass player played the repetitive phrase that would end on a trill on the piano, I liked the suspense and reset back to a fast tempo by the guitar. I thought the song had a fun and upbeat tempo that kept and held the music together, but during solos, Lewis played a bit slower. I thoroughly enjoyed the piano solos and felt myself moving with the music and trying to predict and stay on the beat. Each section incorporated influences from older sounds and music. Because of these various elements and stylistic influences, it also created a new sound categorized as soul jazz.

            <p id="shannon-text2">
              “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” exemplified a true bridging of gospel influences with a new approach on blues and unique rhythms creating the sound “soul” jazz. This song really stood out to me throughout the year. The build up to the chorus line that says, “Have Mercy on Me,” had a really nice flow to it, and I loved following the crescendo and phrase of music. Then after this build up, the quiet down on guitar and back to a smoother line of melody with brass instruments taking over was really exciting to hear. I think what mostly stood out to me was the dynamics. The song had a way of getting quieter and then building up quickly, really grabbing your attention. Both songs clearly demonstrate the incorporation of multiple styles into a innovative sound.
