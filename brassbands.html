        <h1>New Orleans Brass Bands</h1>
        <h3>By Alex Weinberg</h3>
        <p>
          The jazz music of New Orleans Brass Bands is one of the most dynamic forms of jazz, due to its mobile and adaptive nature. The tradition of brass band music in New Orleans can be traced back as far as the late 1800s and early 1900s, but has persisted and even evolved into the mainstream of modern jazz. Brass bands are a staple in the French Quarter of New Orleans, where they march through the streets amongst the people. They are also popular for their place in New Orleans jazz funerals, an example of the role they play in the culture of the city. For me, New Orleans Brass Band music is enjoyable not only for its dance-along sound, but also for its deep connections to the rich history of the city.

          It is not often in jazz that one example can almost perfectly demonstrate all of the intricacies of a certain style, but I believe I have found one for new-age New Orleans brass bands and I want to focus on this one piece for this page. Perhaps no band, song, or video is more representative of the current state of New Orleans brass band jazz today than the following:

            <source src="videos/brassband.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </div>
          <p class="alex-text">
            Nearly everything about this video exemplifies New Orleans brass bands. Musically, the use of the sousaphone to play the bass-line is typical of New Orleans brass bands in their modern form, which has been heavily influenced by the styles of funk and hip-hop. The choice of song, as well, is characteristic of this relatively recent development in the sub-genre. Indeed, the Hot 8 Brass Band website notes that their music is a blend of influences from the Dirty Dozen and Rebirth, with more elements of contemporary R&B, rap, and its local variation, “bounce.”
            Watching the video, one also notices the rest of the instrumentation: a saxophone, two trumpets, and two trombones carry the melodies throughout the piece, and are accompanied by two percussionists, one playing bass and one playing snare. This setup is typical of New Orleans brass bands, again providing a nice example of the modern style of the sub-genre of jazz in general.
            However, what is probably most engaging and characteristic about this video is the scenes of the Hot 8 Brass Band playing throughout the streets of the city. The mobility and dynamism of the music is very apparent in these moments. Furthermore, the band truly draws in the crowd, who clap and dance along with the musicians. New Orleans brass band jazz is unmistakably a music of the people, and that spirit is perfectly encapsulated by this band, this song, and especially this video.
